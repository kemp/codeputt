Create three programs, which we'll call Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

Each program must be unique, and accept input.

If a program gets any input which is not one of the programs Rock, Paper or Scissors, it must print itself.

[RPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) style, the programs will each print one of the following four outputs:

1. "win" if the running program beats the program that is being input
2. "lose" if the running program loses against the program that is being input
3. "tie" if the input is equal to the source code of the running program
4. The source code of the running program itself for any other input (including an empty input)

General rules:

- The three programs can be in any language. Rock can be in a different language from Paper: same for any other pair.
- They are not restricted by size.
- They must print through STDOUT or closest equivalent, and must print strings or closest equivalent. They must not print to STDERR.
- They need not be full programs. They can be functions, if you wish to get rid of the stuff needed in a program, like C's #includes.

This is a [tag:code-golf] challenge, where your score is determined by the sum of the programs' sizes. The person with the lowest score wins.
If two people have the same score, the person whose largest program by bytes out of the set Rock, Paper, Scissors is smaller wins.
